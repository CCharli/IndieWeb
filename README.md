# IndieWeb ðŸŒƒ

Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

IndieWeb is a site that should feel like a piece of home on the internet. In the midst of today's international and inter-personal commotion, it can feel extremely
overwhelming and stressful to complete even the simplest of tasks. Hopefully in all of this, IndieWeb can provide a safe place for us to come together,
relax to some easy music, and find our center again. 

As Voltaire once said,
"Life Is a Shipwreck, But We Must Not Forget To Sing in the Lifeboats"

Take care :)
