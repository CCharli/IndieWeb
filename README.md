# IndieWeb ðŸŒƒ

Hello, there! ðŸŒ±

IndieWeb is a site that should feel like a piece of home on the internet. ðŸŒŽ 

In the midst of today's international and inter-personal commotion, it can feel extremely
overwhelming and stressful to complete even the simplest of tasks. Hopefully in all of this, IndieWeb can provide a safe place for us to come together,
relax to some easy music, and find our center again.

As Voltaire once said,
"Life is a shipwreck, but we must not forget to sing in the lifeboats".

Take care :)

<3 Charli ðŸŒ…
